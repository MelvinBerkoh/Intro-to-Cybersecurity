CIA(Triad)

Confidentiality 
    GOAL: Prevent unauthorized access to data 
    Only authorized users should be able to access sensitive information
    Data privacy and access control

Integrity
    GOAL: Prevent unauthorized modification or destruction of data
    Ensures accuracy and trustworthiness of data and systems
    Data must remain accurate, consistent and trustworthy from creation to use
    Protecting data from tampering, corruption or accidental changes

Availability 

    GOAL: Ensure systems and data are accessible when need 
    Ensures reliable and timely access to resources for authorized users
    Systems and data must be accessible when needed
    Counteracts threats such as denial of service attacks, failures, or overloads
    Loss of availability disrupts operations and user access. 

  Beyond CIA Trow additional Goals : 
Authenticity- Ensures validity, trustworthiness, and genuineness of data and communications
Accountability- Ensures actions can be traced to responsible entities. 

Supports nonrepudiation, deterrence, fault isolation, intrusion detection/prevention and forensic analysis

FIPS 199: INcludes authenticity under integrity. 

            Under FIPS security breaches are categorized into three impact levels:
            Low: Limited adverse effect. Minor financial loss, receded mission effectiveness, minor harm to individuals
            Moderate: Serious adverse effect. Significant financial loss, reduced mission effectiveness significant harm to individuals
            High: Severe or catastrophic effect. Major financial loss, loss of mission capability severe harm including possible loss of life. 


            Developing a robust strategy involves:
RISK = (Threat + Vulnerability + Asset Value) / 3

RISK' = Threat * vulnerability * Asset Value 


Security is not as simple as it first appears
Attackers often think differently exploiting unexpected weaknesses
Security procedures may seem counter intuitive elaborate measures only make sense when threats are fully considered
Deciding where to place security mechanism(physically in networks and logically in architectures) adds complexity
Security depends on secret information (keys), requiring secure creation, distribution and protection. 
Security is a battle of wits - attackers only need to find one weakness; defenders must fix all weaknesses
Perception problem - benefits of security investment often only recognized after failures occur
Security requires constant monitoring, which is difficult iin fast paced environments
Security is often an afterthought added after system designs instead of built- in 


Technical Security measures
Access control: 
                1. Mandatory Access control (MAC)
                2. Discretion Access Control (DAC)
                3  Rule-based Access control (RBAC)
                4. Role-based. Access control (RBAC)
Identification and Authentication
System & Communications Protection
Systems & information Integrity

Attack Surfaces
Attack surfaces are the different entry points an attacker can use to compromise a system
    Network Attack Surface (open ports, services, protocols)
    Software Attack Surface (vulnerabilities in applications, libraries)
    Physical Attack Surface (physical access to devices, hardware vulnerabilities)
    Social Engineering Attack Surface (human factors, phishing)

Attack Trees
Hierarchical stricture of attack strategies
    Root Node: Main goal of the attacker
    Branches: Different methods to achieve the goal
    Leaves: Specific actions or steps to execute the attack

Example of a Virus infection Trees
                Root: Infect System
                    Branch 1: Deliver Payload
                        SubGoal
                        Leaf 1.1: Email Attachment
                        Leaf 1.2: Malicious Website
                    Branch 2: Exploit Vulnerability
                        Leaf 2.1: Unpatched Software
                        Leaf 2.2: Weak Passwords
                

Security Implementation 
For complementary actions:
    Preventive: Stop security incidents before they occur (firewalls, encryption)
    Detective: Identify and respond to security incidents (intrusion detection systems, monitoring)
    Corrective: Mitigate the impact of security incidents (backup and recovery, incident response plans)
    Recovery: Restore normal operations after a security incident (disaster recovery plans, business continuity plans)
