CIA(Triad)

Confidentiality 
    GOAL: Prevent unauthorized access to data 
    Only authorized users should be able to access sensitive information
    Data privacy and access control

Integrity
    GOAL: Prevent unauthorized modification or destruction of data
    Ensures accuracy and trustworthiness of data and systems
    Data must remain accurate, consistent and trustworthy from creation to use
    Protecting data from tampering, corruption or accidental changes

Availability 

    GOAL: Ensure systems and data are accessible when need 
    Ensures reliable and timely access to resources for authorized users
    Systems and data must be accessible when needed
    Counteracts threats such as denial of service attacks, failures, or overloads
    Loss of availability disrupts operations and user access. 

  Beyond CIA Trow additional Goals : 
Authenticity- Ensures validity, trustworthiness, and genuineness of data and communications
Accountability- Ensures actions can be traced to responsible entities. 

Supports nonrepudiation, deterrence, fault isolation, intrusion detection/prevention and forensic analysis

FIPS 199: INcludes authenticity under integrity. 

            Under FIPS security breaches are categorized into three impact levels:
            Low: Limited adverse effect. Minor financial loss, receded mission effectiveness, minor harm to individuals
            Moderate: Serious adverse effect. Significant financial loss, reduced mission effectiveness significant harm to individuals
            High: Severe or catastrophic effect. Major financial loss, loss of mission capability severe harm including possible loss of life. 


            Developing a robust strategy involves:
RISK = (Threat + Vulnerability + Asset Value) / 3

RISK' = Threat * vulnerability * Asset Value 


Security is not as simple as it first appears
Attackers often think differently exploiting unexpected weaknesses
Security procedures may seem counter intuitive elaborate measures only make sense when threats are fully considered
Deciding where to place security mechanism(physically in networks and logically in architectures) adds complexity
Security depends on secret information (keys), requiring secure creation, distribution and protection. 
Security is a battle of wits - attackers only need to find one weakness; defenders must fix all weaknesses
Perception problem - benefits of security investment often only recognized after failures occur
Security requires constant monitoring, which is difficult iin fast paced environments
Security is often an afterthought added after system designs instead of built- in
